		h3 On the 9th of May 2017, the fully independent, punk, Leeds Testing Atelier filled Wharf Chambers with nearly a hundred attendees, speakers, panelists and organisers. Loads of laughter, learning and collaboration ensued! We hope you had fun, the feedback is in and we've got a few things to tweak and some big, serious grown up conversations to have. With beer!
