			"abstract": "As you grow as a tester you start to realise that your organisation is another system which needs attention. No doubt you've come across a process that needs improving or heard complaints about how your organisation operates.I want you to be able to turn those complaints in to actionable information so you can help make positive change for you and everyone in your organisation. In this workshop we'll use a mapping technique to discover: Key relationships and how they might impact you changes in your organisation or processes. Constraints which block or amplify effective communication. Differences among people that contribute to positive change or conflict. Exchanges which can affect the flow of value.",
