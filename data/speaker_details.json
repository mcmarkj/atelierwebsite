			"title"   : "Docker as a Tool for Testers",
			"abstract" : "Serena will introduce you to Docker as a technology, what a container is, how they relate to images and their json configuration. With examples of how they use source control concepts with push and pull commands, to enable the creation of test environments on a per model basis, in order to test not only the code, but that it is an operational entity which can stand alone when deployed. Key takeaways are how Docker can be useful for testers and the benefits of using Docker to create disposable test environments",
			"bio" : "Serena is a Test Engineer at Skybet within the Data Tribe, just getting started after finishing the software academy. Interested in all things testing, big data and technology in general. Has never been known to refuse free beer, and is unlikely to start now.",

			"abstract" : "My session will share our journey building a testing community at work.  You’ll learn about and be able to try some of the challenges we’ve done along the way and how we built a risk based backlog of topics. Hopefully you will be inspired to build your own testing community where you work.",
			"bio" : "I’m passionate about exploring and testing software as part of the creation and development of useful applications. I strongly believe in collaborative methods and using different thinking techniques to look at things from all angles. I have been published in Testing Experience magazine and The Testing Planet. I’ve also given presentations to Agile and Testing groups in London and Yorkshire and contribute to our internal testing community through talks, discussions, blog posts and challenges.",
