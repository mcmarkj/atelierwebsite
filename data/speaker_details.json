			"title"   : "The Sleepy Tester",
			"abstract" : "We all know about the basic human needs: food, water, and shelter. It would be pretty difficult to go about our jobs without those three things. But what about sleep? A lack of sleep is detrimental in so many ways - we can all feel the effects of simply *being* tired, but the harm goes much deeper than that. As testers we need to bring a myriad of skills to be the best we can be: creativity, problem solving, decision making and communication to name just a few. How much does sleep impact these skills and our abilities to improve? This talk will cover the effects of sleep (or lack thereof) on learning, behaviour, and general wellbeing. We don’t expect to be our best selves without basic human needs - why do we neglect sleep so?",

			"title"   : "Imposter Syndrome as a Tester",
			"abstract" : "As a Woman in Tech, I’ve experienced my fair share of self-doubt. It wasn’t until a year or two ago that I learned of Imposter Syndrome, something clicked; like someone handed me a cheat sheet to a jigsaw puzzle. Since then I’ve been learning more about psychology and why people react in a certain way to situations and how my own mind fits into all of this. Nearly 70% of people in tech have said they’ve experience Imposter Syndrome in some way. I want to take you on a journey through my career and what I’ve been doing to fight that Imposter Goblin. The one that won’t stop shouting when you’re trying to be your best self. I am by no means an expert in psychology or medicine, but have always found the area interesting. I do not intend for this talk to be a solution for anyone, but more of a personal journey of what I have been doing in my life and how I have worked toward being the best I can be. I will be providing the disclaimer that I have a background in Electronic and Electrical Engineering and that this talk is to talk about my own experiences and perspective of the tech industry. This is a simple and relatable talk on how I’ve managed to ‘get out of my own head’ and learn to live with Imposter Syndrome, that I hope will be able to inspire people to take themselves out of their comfort zone at work or home.",

I'll be talking about my relationship with failure and how I use failing to teach others. I'll cover my most recent massive fail in some detail and end with an interactive celebration of failure",

In this session we will look at why communication is so important, how to encourage high quality discussion, and how to have those tough conversations we’ve all been avoiding.",

Key take aways - you don't need to be a security expert to help security test your application, incorporating security tests into you existing processes can identify possibly expensive bugs.",

In this talk I'll share my experiences of organising weekly lightning talks at Piksel, how this has helped strengthen the tech community at Piksel, and helped me get where I am today.",

Whenever we have any event around testing in an Agile world we get a lot of questions and animated discussion.

			"title"   : "Web application hacking 101: Live hacking demo",
			"abstract" : "Security is an important requirement when developing quality applications, however it is often overlooked by both developers and testers. Instead, expensive consultants are called in to perform penetration testing. In a penetration test, an ethical hacker will attempt to discover as many vulnerabilities as they can within the testing window. As this is expensive, many applications go live without any security testing. In this talk, I will attempt to demystify security testing, showing why it's important and why you don't need to be a security experts to perform important security checks. We will take a real web application and go though the steps real world hackers would use to gain access to the server. Along the way, we will learn the tools and techniques used and understand how we could have tested this application before it went live.",
