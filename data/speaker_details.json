			"title"   : "Testing Through The Mist of the Twilight Zone",
			"abstract" : "A case study of how changing my team's ways of working on the physical board reshaped how we refined, planned and progressed with our development and embedded all team members and their views throughout the journey.By using the 'Twilight Zone' style of mind mapping our concerns, thoughts and plans into our physical board and removing columns (To DO, DEV, TEST etc) our delivery and quality improved and elements of development were taken out of silos and helped all team members be on the same level. It gave a strong push to test advocacy because the development cycle was seen as something that was considered in every step, not as the last step.",
			"bio" : "I am a Senior Test Engineer at Booking.com's Transport at Manchester division. I am passionate about Agile and Ways of Working which is my strength as a non-technical tester. I am a Chinese born Finnish citizen who has lived in Manchester for 10 years and don't consider myself settled: I am always looking to travel and learn more which also reflects in my eagerness to develop myself in the Tech world.",

			"title"   : "Building Deterministic Infrastructure That Works",
			"abstract" : "In the beginning, we had VMWare, change requests, different environments with different setups, and a lot of headaches! It was impossible to know what the desired state of any environment was. Then, we had cloud providers, who gave us fancy portals where we could provision our resources on the fly much quicker. Yet we still had to build each environment by hand, which is incredibly error-prone. Still we had no real way of knowing what the desired state of a system was, let alone if it was in that state! Now, we have Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Finally a way of defining our infrastructure that is deterministic! Every environment can be the same. We have a source of truth. Change requests are now Pull Requests. This is great, but it doesn’t guarantee that anything works. We’ll explore how to not only test your infrastructure, but also what you should be testing and where the value really is. Is your Infrastructure as Code really the source of truth? Are your assumptions about an implementation detail of your cloud provider actually correct? Most importantly, does your system actually work on the defined infrastructure?",

Prior to that, he spent some time working on security-conscious systems. His current focus is on improving the delivery of effective and usable software.",

			"title"   : "Data Rising",
			"abstract" : "The importance and power of Machine Learning and AI is starting to be explored by more and more software companies. As tester's, where do we fit in, and how do we approach these projects? I recently took on the role of Head of Testing at a data science company, and I've begun my adventure in this exciting space. My task is to establish a test team capable of working on big data/data science projects. I was honest before I was offered the role, reiterating that I don't have any experience in data science! I was reassuringly told, don't worry, we're all figuring this out, come along on the journey. I've covered a lot of ground in the short space of time, and I'm drawing the map as I go, and while I still haven't got my bearings, I know where we are and where we are heading. Join me as I share how I used existing skills to get me started, and what I've learned to add value in a domain I found intimidating. I'll show you my map and point out some of the exciting landmarks along the journey.",
			"bio" : "Christopher Chant is a determined and passionate test professional with experience across multiple domains. He has learned to embrace all parts of the development lifecycle as learning opportunities: working in business analysis, development, testing and coaching roles in an attempt to help teams grow and deliver. When not testing, Christopher spends his time running (not often enough), traveling all over the country to watch Nottingham Forest F.C. lose (occasionally they win), jealously looking at other people's dogs and playing board games.",

			"title"   : "The average tester: how to get and keep a job when you’re not a rockstar",
			"abstract" : "I would describe myself as a bog standard tester, in a good way.  I don’t have much coding knowledge, I haven’t written a book or done anything spectacular, and I spend my time outside of work mostly on raising my family - but this hasn’t stopped me from carving out a career in testing from scratch, keeping getting hired, re-hired and ex-bosses moving somewhere and hiring me again.  I am not exceptional, but, critically, I am also not a dick. I’m often intimidated by the feats of speakers, so I’d love attendees like me to go away knowing there’s longevity to just being good at your job and being good to work with.We shouldn’t pooh pooh the fact that some people work to pay the bills, and I’d love to encourage those people to believe in themselves more and know a long term career is achievable without attaining guru status.",
			"bio" : "I am a tester with over 10 years experience, working for BJSS, QA and Cocoon amongst others.  My new years res was to try my hand at public speaking in 2019, and have been after attending the test atelier for ages - a lightening talk spot would be amazing!",

			"title"   : "Beyond Dashboards - Visualising Complex Systems",
			"abstract" : "It's common practice to collect a multitude of metrics from our builds, tests, releases and running applications. Typically we use dashboard tools to visualise these metrics creating a plethora of interrelated graphs and charts to enable us to quickly review performance, spot anomalies and monitor the health of our system components. Although we may have detailed knowledge of individual components of the system, can dashboards alone give us the ability to understand how those components and the many others relate, interact and operate as a complex system? Based on the analysis of Kubernetes clusters this session will demonstrate ways to \"see\" the workloads running on clusters. Helping to better understand a system through visualisation, anomaly identification and exploratory analysis. Using tools such as graph databases and visualisation tools, you'll see how they can help explore and understand cluster workloads. Sharing examples of how these tools have identified issues and how they can help engage with users of the systems to share best practices and ultimately improve cluster performance. By the end of the session, you'll understand how to apply the same tools and techniques to analyse and understand your own systems.",
			"bio" : "Andy is Lead Platform Engineer at Sky Betting and Gaming. He considers himself a Kubernetes and Hadoop fettler, spending a far too much of his spare time making Raspberry Pis do things they shouldn’t. He is a small part of the organising team for DevOpsDays London confernence and has been runing the Devops meetup in Leeds for 7 years hosting over 50 events. He's attended and spoke at a bunch of DevOps conferences and in his words is 'an all round DevOps nuisance'.",
