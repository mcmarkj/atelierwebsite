			"title"   : "Discovering Logic in Testing",
			"abstract" : "We all test in different ways and sometimes it can be hard to explain the thought processes behind how we test. What leads us into trying certain things and how do we draw conclusions, surely there is more going on here than intuition and luck? After working in games testing for almost a decade, Rosie draws from experience to explain how games testers develop advanced logical reasoning skills. Using practical examples that will make you think, she will demonstrate logical patterns, rules and concepts that can help all of us gain a deeper understanding of what is actually happening in our minds when we test.",
