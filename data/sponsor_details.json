			"about" : "Serena will introduce you to Docker as a technology, what a container is, how they relate to images and their json configuration. With examples of how they use source control concepts with push and pull commands, to enable the creation of test environments on a per model basis, in order to test not only the code, but that it is an operational entity which can stand alone when deployed. Key takeaways are how Docker can be useful for testers and the benefits of using Docker to create disposable test environments",

You’ll learn about and be able to try some of the challenges we’ve done along the way and how we built a risk based backlog of topics. Hopefully you will be inspired to build your own testing community where you work.",
